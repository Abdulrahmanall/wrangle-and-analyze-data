# wrangle and analyze data 

### Poject Details
In this project are as follows:

- Data wrangling, which consists of:
  - Gathering data
  - Assessing data
  - Cleaning data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
- Reporting on 1) your data wrangling efforts and 2) your data analyses and visualizations

### What Software Do I Need?
- You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. 
- The following packages (libraries) need to be installed:
 - pandas
 - NumPy
 - requests
 - tweepy
 - json

### Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project
Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named `twitter_archive_master.csv`. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately.

Analyze and visualize your wrangled data in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. At least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization must be produced.

### Reporting for this Project
Create word written report called `wrangle_report.pdf` or `wrangle_report.html` that briefly describes our wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.

Create a report called `act_report.pdf` or `act_report.html` that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from our wrangled data.
